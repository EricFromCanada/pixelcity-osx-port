# pixelcity-osx-port
This is a port of Pixel City by Shamus Young converted to the Cocoa screensaver architecture for Mac OS X.
The original Pixel City project index is at http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?page_id=16458.

This screensaver uses old-style OpenGL calls (i.e. pre-1.5) and no shaders. I intend to modify it to use shaders as a learning exercise later on.

I have exposed some of the screensaver settings as options, shown below:

I have also added some fog settings, including colour-cycling the fog settings.
